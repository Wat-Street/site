        abstract:
            "In this paper, we introduce WatGPT, a specialized Large Language Model (LLM) designed for handling a range of quantitative finance tasks. Leveraging the latest advancements in model architectures such as Structured State Spaces (SSMs), Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) RNNs, and traditional Transformers, WatGPT aims to provide robust solutions for tasks including portfolio optimization, risk management, and algorithmic trading. Unlike general-purpose models, WatGPT integrates domain-specific knowledge, which significantly enhances its performance on specialized tasks.",
